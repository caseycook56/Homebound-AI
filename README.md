# Homebound: AI

A fantasy game set at night in a procedural generationed rainy forest, you're a dwarven foreman tasked with rescuing the panicked miners before they are attacked by aggressive goblins. The player can control the foreman with the mouse, clicking a spot they wish the foreman to go to. All the while the scared miners will be running around in a panic, while goblins aggressively seek them and the player out. 

The player will be up against 5 goblins while trying to rescue 20 dwarves -- or any defined amount that you wish, up until 200!

If the goblins come in contact with the player, the player will be knocked slightly off course, 1 point will be deducted from the player and the goblins will let up their pursuit for a time. But if the goblins come in contact with a dwarf that dwarf will die and the goblin will score a point for the goblins. 

The objective of the game is to outscore the goblins by saving more dwarves than they can kill. 

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME THROUGH UNITY:

1. Open unity and set the scene to GameScene by going into the folder Assets/Scenes/
2. You can adjust the river in the map by adjusting the River Direction into "north", "south", "west", and "east". Each direction can only be used once :)
3. Adjust the number of dwarves that will be generated by clicking into Dwarves GameObject and edit it in the editor. The default number is 20.
4. You are all set and the Game should be ready to run by hitting the play button! Enjoy!

My contruibution:

- The AI enemy movement of the goblins. 
- Enemies use a AI flocking techinque so they are always in sync with each other and dont move randomly
- Dwarf movement around the player
- When the dwarves are collected they flock around the player and form a vague line
- Enemy collision detection as part of the flocking technquie
